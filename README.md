## What?

A technical indicator is a tool that attempts to forecast a technical analysis feature (e.g. support / resistance) based on given data such as historical price and volume.

Typically, a trader or an investor would use technical indicators against an asset (e.g. stocks), and then perform technical analysis to formulate a trading (or investing) decision.
